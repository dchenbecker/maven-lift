This is where things will stay until we find a permanent home. Until it's hosted on scala-tools.org you'll need to download the sources from here and do a "mvn install" to install the plugin.

Instructions:

To use this plugin, add 

      <plugin>
        <groupId>net.liftweb.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-lift</artifactId>
      </plugin>

To your POM's plugins section. Once you've done that the plugin should automatically run during the compile phase, and will produce a file called <target>/i18n-template.properties that contains all of the found I18N keys. If you want to run the plugin manually, just run "mvn lift:i18ngen".
